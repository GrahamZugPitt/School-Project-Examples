All results generated by running vmsim on 1.trace. It is clear that increasing the number of frames drastically decreases OPT's advantage over LRU. This is not surprising, as the number of frames dictates the size of the linked lists and if the linked list is larger decisions about page faults have to be made less often (and we would probably expect LRU to make more "mistakes" compared to OPT if it has to make more decisions). Increasing the block size drastically reduces the amount of accesses required for either algorithm (by over a factor of 100), so if the goal is to minimize accesses, increasing the block size is a good way to do it.
